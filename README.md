# students-performance-analysis
A project analyzing student performance using Python and ML.
# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis (EDA + ML)

This project analyzes how different factors affect student performance using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds a simple **Machine Learning (ML)** model to predict test scores.

---

## 📊 Dataset Features

- **Gender**
- **Race/Ethnicity**
- **Parental Level of Education**
- **Lunch Type**
- **Test Preparation Course**
- **Scores**: Math, Reading, Writing

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored relationships between student attributes and scores:

- 🧑‍🎓 **Gender**: Female students often score higher in reading and writing.
- 🍱 **Lunch**: Students with **standard lunch** perform better than those with free/reduced lunch.
- 🎓 **Parental Education**: Higher parental education correlates with better student scores.
- 📚 **Test Prep**: Completing the course results in significantly better scores.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

A simple ML model was trained to predict student scores based on their input features.

- ✅ **Model**: Linear Regression
- 🛠 **Features Used**: Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Education, Lunch, Test Prep
- 🔮 **Target**: Math/Reading/Writing Scores
- 📊 Results: Good baseline predictions for small dataset
